## Synopsis

This is a website and a app for a simple recipe finder based on ingredient selection.

## Motivation

This project was created for the CalgaryHacks 2017 Hackathon.
We decided to make Issa Recipe because of the frustration of having lots of ingredients at home. 
by writting the ingredients you already have at home and being lazy to not even bother looking for what to do with them. Issa Recipe brings you the recipes
In addition to this we wanted to build a project that was visual, collaborative, self imposed and useful.


## Installation/Usage

The app can be imported into android studio from the issaRecipe-master/app folder, the website and simply be open from the issarecipe/website folder.
The website is currently hosted using Microsoft Azure, on the domain http://issarecipe.azurewebsites.net/


### Project Timeline

* Day 1
* Brainstormed ideas for a bit then started both website and app simultaneously
* We quickly discovered our idea was not very unique and that websites much better currently exist
* The main design challenge was utilising a database containing recipes and ingredients
* Initially attempted to use SQL database but was unable to link the site and db together
* Thus decided to switch pre-existing api found from site recipepuppy.com
* This solved all remaining problems, made the project too easy
* Day 2
* Everyone being tired went home to recuperate


### Things Gained

* Addition skills with version control software (GIT, Team Foundation, Github)
* Working as a team collaboratively towards a common goal
* Information on difficulty of back end problems 
* solutions for difficult back end problems
* Red Rave is a bad thing
* Sleep is absolutely required
